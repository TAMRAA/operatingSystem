. Concurrent Process can be cooperating ( sharing data and exchanging messages ) and independent

. Information sharing between processes is referred as Inter Process Communication

Communication Models
---------------------

. Shared memory => 2 processes share a common block of memory where they can write and read from

NOTE: Usually done using a File or Mapped file !! ( ALLOW SHARING A LOT A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA )

. Message exchange => 2 processes communicate through the Kernel by mean of system calls and message

NOTE: Usually done by setting up a Communication channel ( Direct OR Indirect )
