Some General Informations about Signals
---------------------------------------

1) Signals are a way for processes to communicate asynchronously

2) Signal handlers are functions executed when a process receives a specific signal

3) The kill() function can be used to send signals to processes identified by their PID

4)The pause() function is used to wait for a signal, making process synchronization simpler
